                                    <p>The future is today. Internet of Things connects all devices to the Internet, creating new opportunities for all products. The customer use of the products can be evaluated and products can be maintained on point by monitoring the data. This leads to cost savings while at the same time increasing the economic value of the product. You also offer your customers a more convenient product by allowing the product to interact with all major smart home platforms.</p>
