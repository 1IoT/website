                        <h4>Third party links</h4>
                        <p>
                            This website contains links to third-party websites ("external links"). These websites are
                            subject to the liability of the respective operators. When linking the external links for
                            the
                            first time, the provider checked the external content for any legal infringements. At that
                            time,
                            no legal violations were apparent. The provider has no influence whatsoever on the current
                            and
                            future design and content of the linked pages. The setting of external links does not mean
                            that
                            the provider adopts the content behind the reference or link as his own. A permanent control
                            of
                            the external links is not reasonable for the provider without concrete indications of legal
                            violations. However, if we become aware of any legal infringements, such external links will
                            be
                            deleted immediately.
