                            In accordance with Art. 13 DSGVO, we inform you of the legal basis of our data processing.
                            If the legal basis is not mentioned in the data protection declaration, the following
                            applies: The legal basis for obtaining consents is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a and Art. 7 DSGVO,
                            the legal basis for processing for the performance of our services and performance of
                            contractual measures as well as for answering inquiries is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO, the
                            legal basis for processing to fulfil our legal obligations is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c DSGVO,
                            and the legal basis for processing to protect our legitimate interests is Art. 6 para. 1

                            basis.
                        </p>

                        <h4> Safety measures</h4>
                        <p>
                            We take appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of protection
                            appropriate to the risk, taking into account the state of the art, implementation costs and
                            the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of processing as well as the different
                            probability of occurrence and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural
                            persons, in accordance with Art. 32 DSGVO. Such measures shall in particular include
                            ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical
                            access to the data, as well as the access, input, transmission, security of availability and
                            its separation. Furthermore, we have established procedures to ensure the exercise of rights
                            of data subjects, deletion of data and reaction to endangerment of data. Furthermore, we
                            already consider the protection of personal data during the development or selection of
                            hardware, software and procedures, in accordance with the principle of data protection
                            through technology design and data protection-friendly presettings (Art. 25 DSGVO).

                        <p>
                            To protect the security of your data during transmission, we use state-of-the-art encryption
                            methods (e.g. SSL) via HTTPS.


                        <h4>Cooperation with order processors and third parties</h4>
                        <p>
                            If we disclose data to other persons and companies (contract processors or third parties)
                            within the scope of our processing, transmit it to them or otherwise grant them access to
                            the data, this shall only take place on the basis of a legal permission (e.g. if a
                            transmission of the data to third parties, such as payment service providers, in accordance
                            with Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b DSGVO for contract fulfilment is necessary), if you have
                            consented, if a legal obligation provides for this or on the basis of our legitimate
                            interests (e.g. when using agents, web hosts, etc.). If we commission third parties with the
                            processing of data on the basis of a so-called "order processing contract", this is done on
                            the basis of Art. 28 DSGVO.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Transmission tio third countries</h4>
                        <p>
                            If we process data in a third country (i.e. outside the European Union (EU) or the European
                            Economic Area (EEA)) or if this occurs in the context of the use of third-party services or
                            disclosure or transfer of data to third parties, this only takes place if it occurs for the
                            fulfilment of our (pre)contractual obligations, on the basis of your consent, on the basis
                            of a legal obligation or on the basis of our legitimate interests. Subject to legal or
                            contractual permissions, we process or leave the data in a third country only if the special
                            requirements of Art. 44 ff. Process DSGVO. This means, for example, processing is carried
                            out on the basis of special guarantees, such as the officially recognised determination of a
                            data protection level corresponding to the EU (e.g. for the USA by the "Privacy Shield") or
                            compliance with officially recognised special contractual obligations (so-called "standard
                            contractual clauses").

                        <h4>Delete your data</h4>
                        <p>
                            The data processed by us will be deleted or their processing restricted in accordance with
                            Articles 17 and 18 DSGVO. Unless expressly stated in this data protection declaration, the
                            data stored by us will be deleted as soon as it is no longer required for its intended
                            purpose and the deletion does not conflict with any statutory storage obligations. If the
                            data are not deleted because they are necessary for other and legally permissible purposes,
                            their processing is restricted. This means that the data is blocked and not processed for
                            other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be retained for commercial or
                            tax reasons. According to legal requirements in Germany, the storage is carried out in

                        <p>
                            Double opt-in and logging: Subscription to our newsletter takes place in a so-called double
                            opt-in procedure. This means that after registration you will receive an e-mail asking you
                            to confirm your registration. This confirmation is necessary so that no one can log in with
                            other e-mail addresses. Subscriptions to the newsletter are logged in order to be able to
                            prove the registration process in accordance with legal requirements. This includes the
                            storage of the login and confirmation time, as well as the IP address. The changes to your
                            data stored with the shipping service provider are also logged.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Credentials: To subscribe to the newsletter, simply enter your e-mail address. Optionally,
                            we ask you to enter a name in the newsletter in order to address us personally.
                        </p>

                            The dispatch of the newsletter and the performance measurement associated with it are based
                            on the recipient's consent pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a, Art. 7 DSGVO in conjunction
                            with § 7 para. 2 no. 3 UWG or, if consent is not required, on the basis of our legitimate
                            interests in direct marketing pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lt. f. DSGVO in conjunction with
                            Section 7 para. 3 UWG.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The registration procedure is recorded on the basis of our legitimate interests pursuant to
                            Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. We are interested in the use of a user-friendly and secure
                            newsletter system that serves both our business interests and the expectations of users and
                            also allows us to provide proof of consent.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Cancellation/Revocation - You can cancel the receipt of our newsletter at any time, i.e.
                            revoke your consent. You will find a link to cancel the newsletter at the end of each
                            newsletter. We may store the e-mail addresses we have unsubscribed for up to three years on
                            the basis of our legitimate interests before we delete them in order to be able to prove a
                            previously given consent. The processing of these data is limited to the purpose of a
                            possible defence against claims. An individual application for cancellation is possible at
                            any time, provided that at the same time the former existence of a consent is confirmed.


                        <h4>Newsletter measurement</h4>
                        <p>
                            The newsletters contain a so-called "web-beacon", i.e. a pixel-sized file which is
                            downloaded from our server when the newsletter is opened or, if we use a shipping service
                            provider, from whose server. Within the scope of this retrieval, technical information, such
                            as information about the browser and your system, as well as your IP address and time of
                            retrieval are initially collected.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This information is used to technically improve the services based on the technical data or
                            the target groups and their reading behaviour based on their retrieval locations (which can
                            be determined using the IP address) or access times. The statistical surveys also include
                            determining whether the newsletters are opened, when they are opened and which links are
                            clicked. For technical reasons, this information can be assigned to the individual
                            newsletter recipients. However, it is neither our endeavour, nor, if used, that of the
                            shipping service provider, to observe individual users. The evaluations serve us much more
                            to recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our contents to them or to send
                            different contents according to the interests of our users.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A separate revocation of the success measurement is unfortunately not possible, in this case
                            the entire newsletter subscription must be cancelled.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Hosting and Mailing</h4>
                        <p>
                            The hosting services we use serve to provide the following services: Infrastructure and
                            platform services, computing capacity, storage space and database services, e-mail delivery,
                            security services and technical maintenance services that we use for the purpose of
                            operating this online offer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We or our hosting provider process inventory data, contact data, content data, contract
                            data, usage data, meta- and communication data of customers, interested parties and visitors
                            of this online offer on the basis of our legitimate interests in an efficient and secure
                            provision of this online offer according to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f DSGVO in conjunction with.
                            Art. 28 DSGVO (conclusion of order processing contract).
                        </p>

                        <h4>Social media</h4>
                        <p>
                            We maintain online presences within social networks and platforms in order to communicate
                            with active customers, interested parties and users and to inform them about our services.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We would like to point out that user data can be processed outside the European Union. This
                            can pose risks for users because, for example, the enforcement of users' rights could be
                            made more difficult. With regard to US providers certified under the Privacy Shield, we
                            would like to point out that they commit themselves to comply with EU data protection
                            standards.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Furthermore, user data is usually processed for market research and advertising purposes.
                            Thus, for example, user profiles can be created from the user behavior and the resulting
                            interests of the users. The usage profiles can in turn be used, for example, to place
                            advertisements inside and outside the platforms that presumably correspond to the interests
                            of the users. For these purposes, cookies are usually stored on the user's computer, in
                            which the user's usage behavior and interests are stored. Furthermore, data can also be
                            stored in the user profiles independently of the devices used by the users (especially if
                            the users are members of the respective platforms and are logged in to these).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The processing of users' personal data is carried out on the basis of our legitimate
                            interests in effective user information and communication with users pursuant to Art. 6
                            para. 1 lit. f. DSGVO. If the users are asked by the respective providers for consent to
                            data processing (i.e. to give their consent e.g. by ticking a checkbox or confirming a
                            button), the legal basis of processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a., Art. 7 DSGVO.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For a detailed description of the respective processing and the possibilities of objection
                            (opt-out), we refer to the information provided by the providers linked below.

                        <p>
                            Also in the case of requests for information and the assertion of user rights, we point out
                            that these can be asserted most effectively with the providers. Only the providers have
                            access to the data of the users and can directly take appropriate measures and provide
                            information. If you still need help, you can contact us.

                            Within our online offer, we make no representations or warranties of any kind based on our

                            "("Google"). The use includes the "Universal Analytics" operating mode. This makes it

                            user ID and thus analyze a user's activities across devices. This data protection notice is
                            provided by www.intersoft-consulting.de.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on your computer, to help the
                            website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your
                            use of this website is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there.
                            However, if IP anonymisation is activated on this website, Google will reduce your IP
                            address within Member States of the European Union or in other states party to the Agreement
                            on the European Economic Area beforehand. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address
                            be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. We would like to point out
                            that on this website Google Analytics has been extended to include IP anonymisation in order
                            to ensure anonymous collection of IP addresses (so-called IP masking). The IP address
